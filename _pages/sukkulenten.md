# Usability Testing: Kakteen und Sukkulenten
The following project was a case study that was provided by the Interaction Design Foundation to apply and integrate the knowledge we gained through taking their course "Design Thinking: The Beginner's Guide".

## Project Brief
The project brief was very short and also just optional. The task was to create a smartphone app which will help people to improve their fitness. The target group were described as people who want to exercise more, but just dont get around to do it for various reasons.

## First Steps
To Analyse the project brief and get an idea of it's content seemed essential to me. I wanted to get an better idea of the problem that lay behind the task to create an smartphone app also in context of contemporary problems like the Corona-Pendemic and its direct consequences like for example more remote work, homeschooling and taking care of children, less contact to ohers, closed sport clubs, etc.
